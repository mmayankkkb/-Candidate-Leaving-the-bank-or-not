# Customer-Bank-Membership-Prediction-using-ANN

I've used Artificial Neural Networks and Random Forest algorithm to train the model to predict Whether the person will exit the bank or not.

Accuracy


Artifical Neural Network -> 84.26666666666667 %


Random Forest Classifier -> 84.46666666666667 %
